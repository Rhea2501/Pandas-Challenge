SUMMARY ANALYSIS: 
The data analysis investigates the financial spending of across various schools and the academic performance of students across these schools. Firstly, we merged the 2 datasets for school and student data, into one and calculated statistics per school such as average test scores in areas such as maths and reading, passing rates and school spending per student. Furthermore, the analysis includes categorising schools based on their spending and size in order to compare their performance by their respective students' maths and reading scores and overall passing rates.


CONCLUSIONS and COMPARISONS: 
1. Firstly, schools with a higher per-student spending do not necessarily perform better academically. For example, the data shows that up until a budget of $630 per student, schools spending anywhere more than that per student, actually had a progressively decreasing passing rate. For example, schools spending $645-$680, had a nearly 4.5% lower passing rate than schools spending $630-$645 per student, who had an 8% lower passing rate than schools spending $585-$630 per student. This suggests that beyond a certain, allocating an increased budget per student, does not necessarily translate to higher academic achievement.

2. Secondly, smaller schools (with fewer than 1000 students), typically have better student performance than larger schools (with 2000-5000 students), as indicated by overall passing rates. Smaller school sizes may mean smaller class sizes, which may allow for a more targetted, focused and personalised attention and guidance per student as well as fewer administrative challenges, hence, providing a more conducive and successful learning environment for students to perform better.
